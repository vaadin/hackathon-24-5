# I had some issues installing CC for the following environment:
- Mac m2 pro
- Colima with aarch_64 emulation profile
- Minikube
- Opened issue: https://github.com/vaadin/control-center/issues/646
- Documentation could be updated to mention that you need to start ip address tunneling for Minikube before trying to install CC
- after that I thought that the installation succeeded, but later stubled on another issue: https://github.com/vaadin/control-center/issues/647


# Investigated how migrate Bakery from version Vaadin 14 to V24_5 using Polymer Template Addon and Copilot
- Find out that GitHub Copilot is working somewhat better than our Copilot when trying to convert an existing Polymer template to pure V24 Java
- Needs more invesitgations...
