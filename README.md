I tried to set up Control Center on MiniKube. Unfortunately the helm command got stuck and failed with an error after 5 minutes when being run on MiniKube. Petri's instructions were vital in having CC running on MiniKube.
Instructions here: https://hub.docker.com/r/petrivaadin/control-center-testing

I'll try the same thing with microk8s as well.
